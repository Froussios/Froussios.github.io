I'm one of those people. I shifted crypto around while it was bubbling.

Now that things are cooling down, I wondered what the aftermath was.
It turns out that I generated too many moves to study manually. The website (kraken.com) doesn't have many tools to help me. Luckily, it's just data, and I'm a programmer. I should be able to create whatever view I want of it.

A few hours late, I had a way to calculate the performance of each individual buying event.

I know people who traded and can't code... yikes. And you're welcome.
